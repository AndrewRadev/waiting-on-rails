## TODO

- Make `rails s` and `waiting-on-rails s` have the same behaviour upon receiving `INT` (regarding message output).
- Extract rails spawning logic somehow
- Specs for `Player`
- Use CC-licensed elevator music
- Add more music: Japanese traffic light?
- Handle more types of music players -- VLC, something on a mac?
- Implement `waiting-on-rake`, which simply waits for the end of the task to stop the music
